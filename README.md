Due Date: 11:59 pm, March 9th, 2025 1. Customers walk   into a   bank and depart   after   receiving   service   at an   average   rate   of   16   per   hour.    There   is   one   clerk   in   the   bank   serving   the   customers.      The   arrival   process   is   random   but   not   Poisson.      Service   time has an exponential distribution with a mean of 3   minutes.    On   average there are 4   customers waiting   in queue to   be served.    On average   how   long   does   a   customer   wait   in   queue?   (5   points)2.   City   bank   has   a   staff   planning   policy   based   on   a   maximum   utilization   level   for   each   operation.   For   example, the allowable   utilization for operation A is 70%.   If the workload for this operation   is expected to   increase    in   the    next      planning    period,    clerks    will    be    hired    to    ensure    the    utilization    to    be    about    70%.   Conversely,   if the   workload   is   expected   to   decline,   clerks   will   be   assigned   elsewhere   as   long   as   the   70%   utilization   rule   is   not violated. The   manager   believes that   such   a   policy   will   allow the   bank   to   maintain   a   specified   customer   waiting   time,   which    is    harder   to    monitor.    An    internal   study   shows   that   for    most   operations, there   is significant variability   in the job   arrival   pattern   as well   as the   processing times   for   the   jobs.   Does this   policy work correctly to achieve the specified customer   waiting time?   Please   briefly justify   your answer.   No calculation   is   needed.   (5   points)3.   An   orange juice vending   machine   can   make   customers   fresh   orange juice   upon   their   arrival. The time   of making a cup of orange   juice is fixed to be 10 min. On average, customers arrive every 15   min.   However,   the   inter-arrival   time   is   actually   random,   and   follows   exponential   distribution.   On   average,   how   many   customers   are waiting to   be   served?   On   average,   how   many   people   are   standing   in front   of the   vending   machine?   (5   points)4. The   unloading dock of the warehouse of PS Supermarket   has a single crew of two workers. The whole   crew   is   needed   to   unload   a   truck.   Truck   arrivals   are   Poisson   with   a   mean   of   3   trucks   per   hour   while   the   unloading   time   per   truck   is   exponential   with   a   mean   of   15   minutes.   If   a   truck   arrives   and   the   crew   is   unloading   another   truck,   the   arriving   truck   joins   the   line   of   trucks   waiting   for   service.   Assume   there   is   enough space to accommodate   essentially any   number of trucks   waiting   in the   line.
(a) What   is the   average   number of trucks   in the waiting   line?   What   is   the   average   time   a   truck   must   wait   in the   line   before   receiving service?   (5   points)
(b) The   management   is considering adding a second crew   of two workers. There   is   sufficient   space   on   the   loading dock to allow two trucks to   unload at the same time.   Each   unloading dock worker is   paid   $100   per   hour   while   the   hourly   cost   of   a   truck   waiting   is   $500.   Complete   the   following   input   table   for   using   the   Queue.xls.   (5   points)

The   company   is   currently   considering two   options. The first   is   a   small   facility   that   it   could   build   at   a   cost   of   $6   million.   If   demand   for   new   products   is   low,   the   company   expects   to   receive   $10   million   in   discounted   revenues   (present value   of future   revenues)   with the   small facility.   On   the   other   hand,   if   demand   is   high,   it   expects   $12   million   in   discounted   revenues   using   the   small   facility.   The second option   is to   build a   large factory at a  代 写DMS2030 Individual Assignment 2
代做程序编程语言 cost   of   $7   million.   Were   demand to   be   low, the   company   would   expect   $10   million   in   discounted   revenues   with   the   large   plant.   If   demand   is   high,   the   company   estimates that the   discounted   revenues   would   be   $14   million.   In   either   case,   the   probability   of   demand   being   high   is   0.4,   and the   probability   of   it   being   low   is 0.6.   Not   constructing   a   new factor would   result   in   no additional revenue being generated because the current factories cannot produce these new products.
(a) Construct a decision tree   for   Expando.   (10   points)
(b) What   is   Expando’s   best decision?   (5   points)6.   Peter   has just   finished   a   whole   day’s   work   and   wants   to   drive   home   as   soon   as   possible.   He   can   first   drive on the Washington Avenue to get to the city   hall, and then   choose   from   one   of the   two   roads to   get   home: the May   Road or the   Lin Road.   He can also drive on the   Ben Avenue to get to the   museum first, and   then choose from one of the two   roads to   get   home: the   Kings   Road or the   Queens   Road. The following   is   a   list of   how   much time   he will   NORMALLY spend on   each   route:Washington Avenue:   10   minutes;   May   Road:   20   minutes;   Lin   Road:   15   minutes;   Ben Avenue:   12   minutes; Kings   Road:   12   minutes; Queens   Road:   18   minutes.There might be traffic   jams on the four   Roads.   If a traffic jam   happens, Peter   has to   DOUBLE THE   NORMAL   TIME   on   the   road.   A   traffic jam   never   happens   on   the   Avenues.   The   probability   of   a   traffic jam   on   each   road   is: the   May   Road: 0.3; the   Lin   Road: 0.4; the   Kings   Road: 0.4; the Queens   Road:   0.3.Before   arriving at the city   hall   (the   museum),   Peter cannot observe whether   there   are   traffic jams   on the   May Road and the Lin   Road (the Kings   Road and the Queens   Road) or   not.   He only   knows the   probabilities.   A traffic jam   is observable   (if   it   happens) when   Peter arrives at the   city   hall   (the   museum). (a)   Construct a decision tree for   Peter.   (10   points)(b) Should   Peter choose the Washington Avenue or   the   Ben   Avenue   at   the   beginning?   (5   points)(Hint:   You   will   need   to   use   the   Rule   of   Multiplication   of   probabilities.   For   example,   the   probability   that   both the   May   Road and the   Lin   Road are jammed   is   0.3   ×   0.4   =   0.12.   ) 

7.   A   post   office   requires   different   numbers   of   full-time   employees   on   different   days   of   the   week.      The   minimum   number of full-time employees   needed on each   day   is   as follows:
Monday

2 Labor   law states that each full-time employee must work five consecutive days and then   receive two   days   off.    For example, an   employee   who   works   Monday to   Friday   must   be   off   Saturday   and   Sunday.      The   post   office wants to   meet   its   daily   requirements   using   only full-time   employees.   Suppose that the   daily   salary   for   each   worker is   $10.   The post office    is    considering how to minimize   the   weekly pay for   full-time   employees.
(a) What are the decisions variables   in this   problem?   (5   points)
(b)   Formulate the   problem as a constraint optimization   problem.   (10   points)
(c)   Now,   suppose that   employees   must   be   paid   double   salary   on weekends.   Formulate the   problem   as   a   constraint optimization   problem.   (5   points)8.   O’Connel   Airlines   is   considering   air   service   from   its   hub   of   operations   in   Cicely,   to   Rome   and   Seattle.   O’Connel   has one gate at the Cicely   Airport,   which   operates   12   hours   per   day.   Each   flight   requires   1   hour   of gate time. Each flight to Rome consumes 15 hours of pilot crew time and   is   expected to   produce a   profit   of $2500. Serving Seattle   uses   10   hours of pilot crew time   per   flight   and   will   result   in   a   profit   of   $2000   per   flight.   Pilot   crew   labor   is   limited to   150   hours   per   day. The   market   for   service   to   Rome   is   limited to   nine   flights   per day. O’Connel wants to obtain the   highest   possible   profit.
(a)   Formulate the   problem as a constraint optimization   problem.   (5   points)
(b)   Draw a graph to   illustrate the constraints.   (10   points)
(c) What   is the   best strategy for O’Connel?   (5   points)
9. Any   more suggestions/comments for the class?   (Optional)
