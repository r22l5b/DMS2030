(a)   Compute the   labor,   raw   material, and total   productivity for each year.   (5   points)
(b) Compute the overall   labor,   raw   material, and total   productivity for the   two   years.   (5   points)2.   The   inventory   of   a   supermarket   turns   46   times   a   year.   The   manager   of   the   supermarket   says   that   everything that the   store   receives from vendors   is,   on   average,   sold   in two   weeks.   Are   these   statements   consistent? Assume there are   52 weeks   in a year.   (5   points)3.   A   truck   rental   company   serves   30   rental   requests   per   week   on   average.    Each truck on   average is   rented   for   3   weeks.       The rental    fee is $1,000 per truck per week. How many trucks are on rent on   average?    What   is the average weekly   revenue?   (5   points)4.   A   hospital   emergency   room   (ER)   is   currently   organized   so   that   all   patients   register   through   an   initial      check-in   process.   At   his   or   her   turn,   each   patient   is   seen   by   a   doctor   and   then   exits   the   process,   either with a   prescription or with admission   to the   hospital.   Currently,   55   people   per   hour   arrive   at   the   ER,   10% of   who are   admitted   to   the hospital.    On    average,   7 people    are   waiting   to be registered and 34 are registered   and waiting to   see   a   doctor. The   registration   process   takes,   on   average,   2   minutes   per   patient.   Among   patients who   receive   prescriptions,   average   time   spent with   a   doctor   is   5   minutes. Among those      admitted to the   hospital,   average time   is   30   minutes.   On   average,   how   long   does   a   patient   spend   in the      ER?   On average,   how   many   patients are   being examined   by doctors?   On   average,   how   many   patients   are      there   in   the   ER?   Assume   the   process   to   be   stable;   that   is,   average   inflow   rate   equals   average   outflow rate.
Please   refer to the diagram   next   page.


(a)   On average,   how   long does   a   patient spend   in   the   ER?   (5   points)
(b) On average,   how   many   patients are   being examined   by   doctors?   (5   points)
(c)   On average,   how   many   patients are there   in the   ER?   (5   points)Note:   In   the   last   stage   (seeing   a   doctor),   there   are   two   types   of   patients,   i.e.   two   types   of   flows.   When   you   consider   the   average   time   in   the   last   stage,   you   should   take   the   weighted   average   because   these   two types of   patients   have different   measures.
5.   Elaine   owns   a   computer   rental   store.       The   rental   process   can   be   depicted   by   the   following   process   flow   diagram.
Customer   arrivals   to   the   store   with   an   average   rate   of   R   =   20   per   week   and   each   customer   requests   for   one   computer. The   rental time   is   3 weeks   on   average. The   rental fee   is   $300   per week. At   the   end   of   the   rental period, the customer returns his/her rented    computer to the store.      Elaine will inspect    every   returned   computer.   The   inspection   time   is   negligible.   On   average   10%   of   the   returned   computers   need   to   be   repaired   by   a   technician   (repair   actually   means   re-configuration   and   minor   repair).   A   computer   that   needs   repair   spends   an   average   time   of   1   week   in   the   repair   stage,   including   waiting   and   repair.After   repair   work   is   completed,   the   computer   will   be   put   into   the   stock   for   rental.   Returned   computers   that   don’t   need   repair will   be   put   immediately   into the   stock for   rental. To   ensure   that   there   are   always   computers   available   to   satisfy   customer   requests,   Elaine   has to   keep   an   average   of   10   computers   in the   stock for   rental.
(a) What   is the total   number of computers that   Elaine   needs   for   her   rental   business?   (5   points)
(b) With an average of   10   computers   in the   stock   for   rental,   on   average   how   much   time   does   a   computer   spend   in the stock for   rental   before   it   is   rented   by a customer?   (5   points)
(c)   Elaine   estimates   that   the   average   rental   time   will   become   2   weeks   if   she   increases   the   rental   fee   to 代 写DMS2030 Individual Assignment 1R

Again, she   needs   to   have   an   average   of   10   computers   in   the   stock   for    rental.    Should she increase the rental fee?      Justify your answer by    considering      the      number      of   computers   required and the expected   revenue   per week.   (5   points)6.   Bandai   has   a   production   line   which   produces   Doraemon   toys.   There   are   three   steps:   in   the   molding   step,   workers   transfer plastic    into   the    white   figures;    in   the    painting    step,   worker   transfer   the   white   figures   into   painted   figures;   in   the   packing   step,   workers   transfer   the   painted   figures   into   final   boxed   toys. Currently, the   number of workers and the time   needed   for   each   step   is   listed   as   follows:
Step

Time   Needed (per   Unit   per Worker)
Molding

(a)   Draw a flowchart to depict the toy   production   process.   (5   points)
(b) What   is the   bottleneck of the   process?   (5   points)
(c)   Suppose   the   demand   for   toys   is   60   units   per   hour.   What   is the   flow   rate   of the   process?   What   is   the   capacity   utilization for each step? What   is the   implied   utilization for each   step?   (5   points)
(d)   Bandai   plans to   hire   17   new workers for the   Doraemon   production   line.   How should   Bandai   train   and   allocate   these   workers   to   different   steps   in   order   to    maximize   the   capability   of   the    production    line?   What   if there are 34   new workers?   (5   points)7. Vernon, Andy,   and   Sean   are getting   ready for their   last   period   in   the   exchange   study   in   CBS.   Following   the   final   exams,   they   intend   to   throw   a   big   party   with   many   of their friends   from   back   home.   Presently,   they   have   identified the   following   set   of   activities that   need to   be   completed. They   decide   to   not   spend   any   work   on   preparing   the   party   until   all   final   exams   are   over.   Moreover,   they   aim   to   spend   a   3-day   beach vacation as early as   possible,   but   not   before all   party   planning   activities   are   completed.On   June   10,   they   will   enter   the   final   exam   week,   which   will   take   5   days.   They   then   want   to   arrange   for      live   music   (which   will   take   5   days),   evaluate   a   number   of   potential   party   sites   (6   days),   and   prepare   a      guest   list,   which   includes   inviting their friends   and   receiving the   RSVPs   (7   days).      They   want to   visit   their      two   most   promising   party   sites,   which   they   expect   to   take   4   days.   However,   this   can   only   be   done   once      they   have completed the   list of   party sites.   Once they   have   finished   the   guest   list   and   received   the   RSVPs,   they   want to   book   hotel   rooms   for their friends   and   created   a   customized   T-shirt   with   their   names   on   it as   well   as   the name of   the   guest.    Hotel room reservation    (3    days)    and    T-shirt creation (6 days) are independent   from   each   other,   but   both   of them   require   the   guest   list   to   be   completed.   Once   they   have      picked   the   party   site,   they   want   to   have   a   meeting   on   site   with   an   event   planner,   which   they   expect   to      take 4 days. And then, once   all work   is   completed, they   plan to   take   off to   the   beach.
(a)   Draw   a   table   to   list   all   the   activities,   their   immediate   predecessors,   and   their   durations.   Draw   the   network   based on the table.   (5   points)
(b) What   is the critical   path?   (5   points)
(c)   For each activity, compute the slack   time.   (5   points)
